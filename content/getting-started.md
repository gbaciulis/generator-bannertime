# Getting Started

Follow these steps to scaffold out a HTML5 banner campaign.

#### 1. Install yeoman, bannertime and gulp globally:

```bash
npm i -g yo generator-bannertime gulp
```

#### 2. Create a new directory:

```bash
mkdir my-new-banner && cd $_
```

#### 3. Run the generator:

```bash
yo bannertime
```

> The generator will then prompt you with a few questions about which kind of project you'd like to generate.
